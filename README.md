Woodcoin Core integration/staging tree
=====================================

This project aims to build a fully armed and operational bitcoin-core ported to the woodcoin network.  

Three tasks make this port complete:

1) Skein hash function for Proof Of Work
2) secp256r1 for ECDSA signatures
3) Logarithmic supply curve

Once complete, we have a segwit-enabled woodcoin network in place.

In the meantime, please continue to use the full woodcoin node and client:

What is Woodcoin?
----------------



Woodcoin is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Woodcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. Woodcoin Core is the name of ONE open source
software which enables the use of this currency, built from the code made by the 
wizards of the bitcoin-core team. 

Woodcoin differs from its predecessors bitcoin, woodcoin, dogecoin, ethereum, et al.
in that it is designed to have a money supply curve which might last more than 20 years.
Bitcoin and woodcoin employ an exponentially decreasing reward drop which means that miners 
are likely to flee, unless fees grow exponentially, in which case users will flee.  


For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Woodcoin Core software, see [https://Woodcoin.org](https://Woodcoin.org).
